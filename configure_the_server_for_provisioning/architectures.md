# Architectures

Double check that the **Architectures** are created already

```
hammer  architecture list
---|-------
ID | NAME
---|-------
2  | i386
1  | x86_64
---|-------

```

As **architectures** dont cant be allocated to a **location** or **organisation** there is nothing to do here other than verify that the configure script created them
