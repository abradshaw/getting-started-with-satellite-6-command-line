# Configure the Server for Provisioning

There are a number of things that need to be defined before we can add a new host to be provisioned.

The following items need to be defined

* Architecture
* Domain
* Activation Key
* Partition Table
* Subnet
* DHCP Proxy
* DNS Proxy
* Realm Proxy
* TFTP Proxy
* Provisioning Templates
* Operating Systems

Each will be discussed in its own section
