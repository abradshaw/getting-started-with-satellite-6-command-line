# Initial Configuration, adding Red Hat Repos

The following sections will cover adding different repositories (or repos) to the Satellite server, starting with the official Red Hat repos. Adding other repos will be left until the next book

Each type of repo can either be syncronised on demand or alternatively can be scheuled to syncronise on a regular basis

Before we can add Red Hat repositories, we need to create an organisation and location then create and import a manifest file however.
