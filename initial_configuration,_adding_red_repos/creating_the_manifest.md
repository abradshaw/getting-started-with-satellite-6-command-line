# Creating the Manifest

Login to [access.redhat.com](http://access.redhat.com) to generate our manefest file.

Locate the system, within [access.redhat.com](http://access.redhat.com).

Be sure to re-set the **Version**, if it has become unset (as in the screenshot below) and hit **Update**

Then locate the "Attach a subscription" (bottom right in the screenshot below).

![Attach Subscriptions](../images/attach-subscription.png)

Navigate to the subscription you wish to add, select the checkbox on the left and enter a quantity on the right before selecting **Attach Selected**



![Attach Subscriptions](../images/attach-subscription2.png)

It may take some time to attach the subscription, as it will say on the screen (see screenshot below).

Hit refresh from time to time until it completes and then click on the **Download Manifest** button and save the mainfest somewhere safe
