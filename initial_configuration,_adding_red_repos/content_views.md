# Content Views

At this point we will have to wait for our Red Hat Repositories to be syncronised, before we define content views.

Content views contain RPM packages from repos as well as puppet modules from puppet repos. Everything needed in order to correctly configure the hosts

Once defined, your content views will be **published** and **promoted** to the appropriate **Lifecycle Environment**
