# Getting Started with Satellite 6 Command Line
>**NOTE**:
This book has now been updated to Satellite 6.1

>The previous version of the book had a number of work arounds included that are now, no longer necessary

----
In this, the second book in the series, we look at using Satellite 6's command line tool, called Hammer

While the web interface is very nice, its often more efficient to use the command line, especially as it enables scripting.

We shall again start of with focusing on configuring a freshly installed Satellite so that it can provision machines. We will use an "all in one" setup, where the Satellite box will also perform DNS, DHCP and TFTP

Many of the first steps are identical to those in the sister book **Getting Started with Satellite 6**, but we have included them here anyway
